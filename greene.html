          For the class ME 125: Visual Frontiers, I was given the imperative to create an entire brand from scratch. This included creating a brand identity, narrative, and variety of interactions: posters, website, etc. The brand I created was greene wrld: a snow and skate apparell company (fictionaly) founded with my sister.

        <b>Logo Generation</b>
        <br>I started with traditional pen and paper to create a logo for my brand. The hand drawn typography ended up becoming a central component of brand identity, and over the course of the project I explored using different mediums to create a 3d version of the sprial logo. The final results were created using Procreate, Adobe Illustrator, & Blender.

        <b>Additional Branding</b>
        <br>While the logo was the foundation of brand identity, I also developed a variety of other components. These included a brand profile, a promotional video, and posters pictured below.

        <b>Website</b>
        <br>I followed the standard design thinking process to develope the final high-fidelity prototype of greene.wrld. I also used a mobile first approach to designing the website for a challenge. The final form of greene.wrld uses familiar touchstones and elements of a traditional online commerce website in order to stay familiar and easy to navigate for the user. However, I use color and font creatively to make sure the website fits in with the creative “outsider” brand identity that I established for greene.wrld. For this prototype, I also learned how to integrate Figma interactions and parallax scrolling into my designs.
